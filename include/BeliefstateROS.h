      Searches the environmental variables ROS_WORKSPACE,
      CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, and ROS_PACKAGE_PATH (in that order) for the
      current ROS workspace. The semantics are as follows:

       - If ROS_WORKSPACE is not empty, use it's value.
         Else:
       - If CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is not empty, use it's first token
         separated by ':', without it's possibly trailing '/devel'
         postfix.
	 Else:
       - If ROS_PACKAGE_PATH is not empty, use it's first token
         separated by ':', without it's possibly trailing '/src'
         postfix.
      
      If all of this fails, return an empty string. During
      initialization of the belief state system, this value will be
      checked. If it is empty at that time, a warning will be
      printed. The configuration file allows for manual override of
      this in case the workspace directory cannot be detected
      properly. */
